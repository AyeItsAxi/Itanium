<p align="center">Topify is a Spotify overlay that looks like Discord's Spotify embeds, while<br>giving bonus features that you would find in your<br>ordinary Spotify player.</p>
<br><br><br>

# How do I download it?
Topify is easy to download. Simply grab the latest [release](https://github.com/AyeItsAxi/Topify/releases) from the GitHub repository to get started.

<br><br>

# I've got it downloaded. Now what?
To get into Topify, follow these steps: 
* Extract the zip file you downloaded from the "How do I download it" section above.
* Run Topify.exe (Note: Windows may say this program may not be safe. This is because I'm not paying money I don't have to get Microsoft to stop.)
* Topify will open a Spotify tab in your browser. From there, allow the permissions asked.
* Done! Enjoy Topify!

<br><br>

## Note from the developer
* Topify is highly unoptimized currently and will have lots and lots of bugs and crashes, as it's currently in a pre-release stage. These issues will be resolved over time, however I don't have very much free-time and this "over time" may be a very long time. If you are consistently experiencing issues, please let me know through the [issues](https://github.com/AyeItsAxi/Topify/issues) tab on this repository.
